# Monte-Carlo-Simmulation-and-Option-Pricing
Monte Carlo Simulation (or Method) is a probabilistic numerical technique used to 
estimate the outcome of a given, uncertain (stochastic) process. This means itâ€™s a 
method for simulating events that cannot be modeled implicitly. This is usually a 
case when we have random variables in our processes.

Theoretically the price of an option should be the present value of expected payoff 
of the option at expiry. 
There are several ways to price an option
a) Using closed form analytical solutions, such as Black-Scholes model
b) Using numerical techniques such as Monte-Carlo simulations, Binomial tree 
pricing, finite differencing.
