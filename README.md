# Monte-Carlo-Simmulation-and-Option-Pricing
Monte Carlo Simulation (or Method) is a probabilistic numerical technique used to 
estimate the outcome of a given, uncertain (stochastic) process. This means itâ€™s a 
method for simulating events that cannot be modeled implicitly. This is usually a 
case when we have random variables in our processes.
